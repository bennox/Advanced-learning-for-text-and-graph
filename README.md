# Advanced learning for text and graph data 

Can you predict whether two short texts have the same meaning? 

Project for the course Advanced learning for text and graph data at ENS Cachan (lecturer: Michalis Vazirgiannis).

## Kaggle competition

The goal of this competition is to predict which of the provided pairs of questions contain two questions with the same meaning.

The ground truth is a set of labels supplied by human experts. This is inherently subjective, as the true meaning of sentences can not be known with certainty. Human labeling is a 'noisy' process, and different people would probably disagree. As a result, ground truth labels on this dataset should be taken as indications but not 100% accurate, and may include incorrect labeling.
