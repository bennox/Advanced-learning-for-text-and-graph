# Advanced learning for text and graph data 

The ALTEGRAD course (28 hours) aims at providing an overview of state-of-the-art ML and AI methods for text and graph data with a significant focus on applications. Each session will comprise two hours of lecture followed by two hours of programming sessions.

Project for the course Advanced learning for text and graph data at ENS Cachan (lecturer: Michalis Vazirgiannis).

## Final project : "Can you predict whether two short texts have the same meaning?"

The goal of this competition is to predict which of the provided pairs of questions contain two questions with the same meaning.

The ground truth is a set of labels supplied by human experts. This is inherently subjective, as the true meaning of sentences can not be known with certainty. Human labeling is a 'noisy' process, and different people would probably disagree. As a result, ground truth labels on this dataset should be taken as indications but not 100% accurate, and may include incorrect labeling.
